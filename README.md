⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.10+

MLflow

Conda or virtualenv

Install dependencies:

pip install mlflow


## Tracking Experiments

Start the MLflow tracking UI:

mlflow ui


Open in browser: http://localhost:5000

## Saving and Loading Models

Train and log model:

import mlflow.sklearn
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")


Load model for inference:

model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model("runs:/<run_id>/model")

## Deployment

Export model for serving:

mlflow models serve -m runs:/<run_id>/model -p 1234
